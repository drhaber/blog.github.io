# Why I did it
Why did I delete my socials?

Political Climate

 The current Political Climate but especially the uncertainty and looming dread of January 2025 was a large motivation for my separation from social media with a specific emphasis on Meta products. 
 
 Back in January during the events of the inauguration I sent it upon myself to cut ties with all companies whose leadership was present at that event. This resulted in me canceling every streaming platform i was subsribed to, canceling my Prime Membership, altering my spending habits and stores I shopped at, canceling Audible, getting a library card, and even going so far to shift my GPS data logging away from Google to a local solution. 

All these changes were a direct result of the overwhelming aniexty I felt with having an outward and accessible collection of data loudly declaring who I was. I was friented of what these companies could do and so terrified of what was about to come. Knowing now, in November of 2025, that anxiety was not misplaced and the atrocities we've been bear to witness are incomprehensible for any one mind. I've also come to realize that simply alienating myself by not engaging with social media isn't actually impacting my aniexty in a positive way and the loneliness I've come to feel by missing out on conversation or posts or knowings of happenings has been challenging.

## So what has it been like?

 The separation and changes I made ultimately began a very interesting segue into a new normal for me.

What started as a deliberate act of boycotting and resignation with the temporary shut down of tiktok quickly started to shift into an understanding of how much more enjoyable consuming media is when it isn't given to you without effort. I started reading a lot finishing books at an average pace of a week and half. I started getting more engaged with watching documentaries and reading scientific publications. I discovered a collection of long form content vloggers I just simply never knew I'd love as much as I do.

I began realizing I was utilizing my phone less and my laptop, desktop, and projector setup more. The shift caused by lacking a method to scroll on my phone shifted  on any things for me. I started journaling a lot, and writing poetry. I started working on a novel and a screenplay. I've found myself trying to fill the gaps of time I used to spend scrolling with sudden moments of creativity.

All of these alterations in habits started to make me question why I lug this black rectangular computer around with me everywhere I go. I started reevaluating what I was missing out on by this level of disconnect.

I don't know what my relationship is to social media and my palpable disdain for it that's fester over these months but I ultimately rebooted Instagram. I don't know what my use of it will look likee btu I intend to use this space to share what I have been working on.

I'm not confident a social media platform really exists out there for me. So I hope to try to use this space to create what I can't find. 

I hope you enjoy and stick around.
