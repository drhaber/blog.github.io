# Why I did it
Why did I delete my socials?

Political Climate

 The current Political Climate was a large motivation for my separation from social media with a specific emphasis On Meta products. Back in January during the events of the inauguration I sent it upon myself to cut ties with all companies whose leadership was present at that event. This resulted in me canceling every streaming platform i was subsribed to, canceling my Prime Membership, altering my spending habits and stores I shopped at, canceling Audible, getting a library card, moved my GPS data logging and various other forms of personal information storage from Google to a local solution. This ultimately began a very interesting segue into a new normal for me.

What started as a deliberate act of boycotting and resignation with the temporary shut down of tiktok quickly started to shift into an understanding of how much more enjoyable consuming media is when it isn't given to you without effort. I started reading a lot finishing books at an average pace of a week and half. I started getting more engaged with watching documentaries and reading scientific publications. I discovered a collection of long form content vloggers. 

I began realizing I was utilizing my phone less and my laptop, desktop, and projector setup more. The shift caused by lacking a method to scroll on my phone shifted quote a few things. I started journaling a lot, and writing poetry. I started working on a novel and a screenplay. I've found myself trying to fill the gaps of time I used to spend scrolling with sudden moments of creativity.

All of these alterations in habits started to make me question why I lug this black rectangular computer around with me everywhere I go. I started reevaluating what I was missing out on by this level of disconnect.
I noticed people aren't to keen on texting all the time and seldom see it as a method to keep in touch anymore. It has been alienating in it's own way not knowing what's going on unless someone tells you and people not knowing what's going on unless they ask. The prevalence of social media as truly altered the way we socialize and I have not been a part of that for the past 10 months and I don't know exactly how I feel 

I ultimately rebooted Instagram. And I intend to use this space to share what I have been working on.

Come read my shitty poetry. 
Come look at the plethora of projects I'm working on.
Come visit this page and see what I'm up to because I miss sharing what I'm up to and I'm not confident there exists a social media platform out there for me to share it all.
