 Why did I delete my socials?  

 In a Short - Political Climate  

 The uncertainty and looming dread I had felt leading into and within January 2025, was a large motivation for my separation from social media with a specific emphasis on Meta products. 
 
 Back in January during the events of the inauguration I sent it upon myself to cut ties with all companies whose leadership was present at that event. I ended up canceling a myriad of services I had subscriptions for. From video streaming, audio books, or express shipping programs I ended up altering my spending habits and stores I shopped at. I got myself a library card and even went so far to shift my GPS data logging away from Google to a local solution. 
 
 All these changes were a direct result of the overwhelming anxiety I was experiencing as we began these next four years. Freighted and terrified of what these companies could do with having an outward and accessible collection of data declaring who I was, leaving me paralyzed by what was to come.
 
 Engaging in this online presence exodus was an attempt to exercise agency and control over this paralysis. In the end however, these fears and anxieties have continued to be omnipresent. No matter how much I alienated myself and abstained from the participation in social media and algorithm-driven media I have not felt any perceivable impact on my anxiety and the loneliness I've come to feel by this behavior has been challenging on to itself.

 I do not know yet what my relationship is to social media and my palpable disdain for it that's festered over these months, but I ultimately rebooted Instagram. In time I hope my use of it will look like will emerge but for now I intend to use this blog space to share what I have been working on.
 
 I hope you enjoy and come back around from time to time.
