Laying in this Tautochrone

A fabric indentation 
A body soft at rest
Compression of foam
Soft for rest

A being horizontal 
A window askew
Cotton and wood  
And Light pools

Warm in glow a filament so bright 
Cold and blue a wall of light
Parallax of size this wall appears
In stunning detail of the entire world

This windows bring forth 
That which contradicts
The warmth and the glow 
Of this space I nest

It displays injustice 
It displays violence 
It displays despair 
It displays hope
It displays humor
It displays grief 
It displays fear
It displays justice 
It displays 
It displays 
It displays 
It displays 

It distances
It separates 
It contradicts
It erodes 
It 
It 
It is not of this warmth 
It is not of this softness 
It is not of happiness 

It is ubiquitous 

And the drive of which I rest
These nodes of reality coalesce 
Rapidly and all at once
This decent down the Tautochrone curve
