I struggle old tools not new  
When forged a bit cruel  
Restraint has been useful  
It always felt unthoughtful  
  
It worked for me before  
But not now too crude  
I know I must cast forth  
This time whilst nude  
  
It is now I palpitate  
Struggling to dispose these old tools  
Weaving of new I resuscitate  
Now with words I begin to spool
