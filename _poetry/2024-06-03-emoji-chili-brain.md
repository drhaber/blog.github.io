actually, I do think I’m better than you  
because while you were busy squabbling and posturing and whining  
and exercising your authoritative muscles  
  
myself and the rest of us Neuro Spicy people  
we’re just getting shit done  
we’re spending time  
being there for each other  
working collaboratively  
contemplating how we impact the world  
How we influence our surroundings 
  
Ask ourselves, how can I be better?   
contemplate what we’re doing wrong  
Agonize over  
Become anxious and overwhelmed  
attempt to consider our every step  
  
and yeah  
  
as I write this poem as I break this proverbial fourth wall, I wonder did my opening line overstep. Did I put too much self absorbed ego behind such a statement. Did I go out of my way to flex my superiority?
