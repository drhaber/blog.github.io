You asked me to coffee  
Your intentions vague  
I welcomed the uncertainty  
I liked this cloud of spores  
  
I breathed them in deep  
Elevated by its mass  
A glorious journey  
One that left me perplexed  
  
This joyous cloud of substance  
One which needs no roots  
A vast haze without candor  
Growing and taking hold  
  
Let's bask in its greatness  
In the feeling it bestows  
Emanating from your silence  
In those words you have not told  
  
This mycelium it grows  
And with wonder it bestows  
It grows no roots as it folds  
It will not last and it will be fast
