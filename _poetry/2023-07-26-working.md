Work is tough it is a drag  
I moved past the flexing  
Of those oh so creative slabs  
Stuck within these cells  
ones white and without walls  
Depicted on a screen  
Each filled with data  
numbers and letters and part numbers  
All around like a sea  
  
I'm not doing as much R and D  
Too much management you see  
People and things  
documents and tea
