Like the pandemic the signs of you still  
They're there reminding us of the past  
  
Keep distanced, 6 months single  
Wash thoroughly, deleting photos  
  
And lord knows I never do  
  
Like the pandemic the signs of you still  
They're there reminding us of the past  
  
Keep distanced, 6 months single  
Wash thoroughly, deleting photos
