Transversing the blackened rivers  
Traveling with the stream  
Hundreds of us each but how many a new  
How many are taking that deep breath  
  
At fifteen you said  
"Take a deep breath Gurl"  
"As you walk through the Doors"  
At double that time I will heed that advice  
  
This place is new and quaint  
It is strange and the lights are faint  
It smells of potential and history  
A new space to be ingrained  
  
Powering on and sharing names  
Papers and screens and chairs that spin  
Candy and decor personality all around  
These people are sweet they are all so kind  
  
This space is new  
If I've been surveying well  
This place brings hope   
But will it be a lucky 13 for this
