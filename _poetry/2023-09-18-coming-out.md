The restaurant of mid century gold  
You were annoyed  
I was overwhelmed  
  
It was loud  
I capitulated to going cause you wanted  
I didn't want to be there  
  
You vocalized a kind of frustration  
You were annoyed your "male" partner kept going to these events with you  
  
You told me I don't belong  
You accused me of making people uncomfy  
  
I couldn't bear it the fear overwhelming  
By form of exclusion  
I came out  
  
I told her I'm not a man  
I'm nonbinary and that  
This was not the first time I told this  
  
I resented the need to defend myself  
Defend Myself from you  
I hate what you said  
I hate what you meant  
  
You then came out yourself after me only moments  
And we sat there and pondered  
If this happened   
You saying you're not bi and me saying I'm not a man  
Did that make us fate sealed  
  
The fear of what came next  
A whole fucking year later  
I think we died in that Blonde Cafe  
  
Each a dead self and then later  
Us
