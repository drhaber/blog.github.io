To be before a site so radiant  
The World usually a gradient  
Now bathed in your ever casting gleam  
I pinch twice, is this a dream  
  
Staring forward trying to meet your gaze  
Oh it is so difficult before your rays  
You witness my trepidation  
You grab me firm, no hesitation  
  
Your radiance your glow  
Now traveling from within it flows  
Through your arms through our clasped hands  
I too feel glow from within me it fans  
  
Your glow transcends evermore radiating from you  
Oh, oh my, I stand before this view  
Together our hands gripping like glue  
Meeting your gaze now I understand you see this too
