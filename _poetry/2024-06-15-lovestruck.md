My god is it me or is it just you  
My heart palpates while in the same room  
Colour so drab, all the world with this hue  
I begin to contemplate our future, in bloom  
Your aura, an obsession, my mind askew  
Why can’t I taste any of this food  
Overwhelmed, my brain a chemical stew  
I lack focus, direction, I’m lost in the nude  
How do I bring it back a kiss, a hug, a screw  
What I need is a date but only just with you
