Petals were once the answer  
Plucking them one by one  
She loves me, she loves me not  
I love her, I love her not  
  
An archaic system  
Always determinant  
Decided at the bud  
Emotions seldom are  
  
With time we could've entangled  
But that we didn't get  
Using metaphors of light and sound  
Of radiance, and symphonies  
  
I seek something tangible  
Yearn to entangle my feelings  
Using a cat I'll place them in a box  
Check on them when I need to  
  
Today I needed to  
And,  
  
I'm sorry  
This wave form has collapsed  
The cat is dead  
  
Please try the experiment again.
