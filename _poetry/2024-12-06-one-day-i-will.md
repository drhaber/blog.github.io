You were are and continue to be  
A person i wish not to see  
Yet as time lapses I know  
You keep appearing to me  
  
I don’t want this to be so  
But time is a mistress  
Always present and known  
What will it take to eject  
  
Remove you from my present  
My dreams aren’t always a haven  
This city despite its size  
Provides no departure  
  
A past of that still haunts  
Despite my best efforts  
You persist always  
Please just leave me alone  
  
But it is not you  
Those words are not for you  
They are for me  
For you still live on  
 
Within my waking memories  
Within my sleeping thoughts  
I strive to expunge you  
And maybe one day I finally will
