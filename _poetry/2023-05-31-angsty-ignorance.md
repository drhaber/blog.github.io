People are bit awful  
Not always quite self aware 
They tend to be incapable  
But it is not their inability to do  
  
But rather them  
Not knowing their own limits  
the limits of their mushy pink folds  
It's ok to not know something  
  
But by that fact and your ignorance  
It's always accompanied by aggression  
Just learn to be ok with not knowing  
Be comfortable with admitting and saying  
  
I need some help cause I do not know  
Don't fabricate lies  
Don't obsfucate such truth  
  
It's ok to not know something  
Because in the chance I don't know too  
  
I'll be there to say  
"hey let's figure it out... together"
