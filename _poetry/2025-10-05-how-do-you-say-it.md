Do you declare it? Use your whole chest?  
Do you scream it? From a mountain top?  
Do you weep? Let it all stream down?  
Do you jump? Move all about?  
Do you Dance? Using your hands and feet?  
Do you run? Sprint about the room?  
  
I can tell you what he does  
  
He jumps high into the air  
He kicks his feet about  
His whole body twists   
Even if he does not shout  
He'll sprint about the room  
Almost as if he can't see  
He'll slam into your feet  
  
And jump about some more
