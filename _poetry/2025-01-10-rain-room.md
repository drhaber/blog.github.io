What is this room of rain  
Warm Steamy and Usually Grey  
A place of washing  
Only of body would be fallacy  
  
This space washes the mind  
The thoughts here are profound  
Seldom Useful, maybe  
But meaningful and sound  
  
A place to contemplate the day  
Either ahead or behind  
Often Both  
This places washes  
  
And it often sounds like rain
