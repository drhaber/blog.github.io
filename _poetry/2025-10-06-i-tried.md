I asked for his opinion  
He simply just stared  
  
I told him it mattered  
He simply just stared  
  
I held up the options  
He simply just stared  
  
I asked him again  
He simply just stared  
 
I turned around with indignation  
He simply just stared  
  
I than place them down  
And lunged for both he tried  
He gobbled them right up without care  
He made an honest mess and cleaned that too  
  
Maybe he doesn't care  
Or doesn't understand  
But either way  
I guess I tried
