All I want is the attention  
All I want is yours  
All I ask is that you see  
All for what I am  
  
All of what outlet exists for me  
All medium of para  
All gone by my hand  
All snapped to ether  
  
All that I would share  
All that I would post  
All now sits ’n lists  
All bobbing about the sea  
  
All empty the dam built  
All resting on the sea bed  
All the sea of dopamine gone   
All held back by my hand
