I had my first night home  
lived here for months  
Now across each season  
Though not quite a year  
  
But this period of ten of Teshuvah  
I find solace that in which I hear  
  
I had my first porch night  
In the month of comfort  
It was cozy with fall's blanket chill  
October here not to pass by  
  
The sounds of my neighborhood  
  
The noise of cars the hum of hvacs  
The whistle of the occasional gust  
The rhythmic thump of a court game  
Pickleball only the next block over  
  
This house is what I wanted  
Not a condo not detached  
Not suburban but really  
Really truly urban  
  
The whine of the El  
That melodic symphony  
The one only a train makes  
Sharp and tonal with a crescendo  
  
This night makes me reminisce  
  
Those evenings on Rock Lake  
Down south near the town of mouse  
I sat on that porch  
Not often but enough  
  
I sat on that porch with my dad  
And we would have a Farbrengen  
In the warm swampy air  
Heavy and sticky  
  
But there I'd hear  
The roar of the frogs  
The chirp of the cicada  
The hoot of the occasional owl  
  
A splash of a bass  
Just jumping up for a snack  
  
That lake that porch that house  
That was home  
It may have only been a 100 days each year  
But it was home  
  
And now last night I felt it  
that calm comfort  
That feeling that feels  
Like home somehow  
  
But it is not somehow  
It is not fleeting  
  
Lake stares from across the room as I write  
  
And in that moment I noticed  
The love around me  
This is my neighborhood  
And this is my home  
  
And for the first time in months  
And for the first time in decades  
Just last night now  
  
This is home  
I feel home
