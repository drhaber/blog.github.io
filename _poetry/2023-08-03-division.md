There's a common theme with how things are divided at the end  
Why does one always suffer more  
Why does one always feel as if they missed out  
  
Love is but a challenge  
It's scary it's terrifying  
Why do we give someone such power  
the power to rip it all way  
  
Why does the journey always end  
The destination there to rip things away  
Things we hold dear  
  
Pets  
Pictures  
Paintings  
Stories  
  
All ripped from us all torn away  
All removed all kept by one  
If not one then by none  
  
Why is one always unable to continue  
 
Pets  
Pictures  
Paintings  
Stories  
  
Why does one always have to be less  
What's the point in a lack of equality  
Where's the source of this scarcity  
Why does it happen
