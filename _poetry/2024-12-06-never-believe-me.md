Back in the past  
A time of overwhelming despair  
I feared then and asked  
How long will all of this last  
  
The stars told me it would be a quest  
One I would only just begin to embark  
They had said it would be a lonely one  
Those around me told me it was for the best  
  
The words of the stars they said  
It will be a lonely lonely adventure  
But looking back I must acquiesce  
That feeling only was when I laid in bed  
  
Reality differed greatly  
The journey I was about to begin  
I know I never would believe  
The words I’d share earnestly  
  
For surrounded by many  
Friends of all sorts  
Relationships of varied length  
A glimpse to the future worth every penny  
  
I know now for sure  
If I could tell me then  
The journey was beginning  
I would never believe no matter how demure
