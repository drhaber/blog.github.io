Why do we say Longing  
What makes this epoch so tantalizing  
  
Is it the anticipation  
The uncertainty  
  
But if uncertain  
Why assume  
Why assume it will be long  
And what is the scale  
  
Is it time  
Is it the hail mary of a pass  
  
Extending your self out far  
hoping a hand glues to yours right back?
