She’s being flirty with me over text  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
She responds periodically  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
This rhythm provides no recourse  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
I know not what is on her mind  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
My mind begins to wander  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
It begins to conjure  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
Stuck here waiting between the rumbles  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
It buzzes from across the room  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
The shape of your name text in white  
I really am just an anxious mess  
  
Words of flirtatious double entendres  
I really am just an anxious mess
