This moisture it appears  
A liquid slightly salty in taste  
translucent and without haze  
  
Sometimes it's a trickle  
Rarely it's a river  
Often it just pools  
  
But right now  
while the source stews  
It's filled with a longing  
  
It collects near its ducts  
Swashing down and around  
A sniffle it'll cause  
  
This face is leaking  
Another tissue dabbing  
It's all part of the healing
