I'm pretending that I'm OK  
But the truth is  
And it really hurts to say  
But I'm only just barely getting by  
  
It's a world of hurt and pain  
And I cannot  
I feel I must scream  
But for I have no strength  
  
I feel lost and used  
Drained and abused  
Exahausted and disused  
  
Suffering is what I know  
A feeling I can hold  
I know I'm not alone  
But when will this grip  
Slacken and dissolve  
  
I struggle for growth  
Obstacles ubiquitous  
A sight so unequivocal  
A truth I try to disown  
  
I'm only just pretending  
But I'm really not ok  
I write here these thoughts  
An attempt to acquiesce  
To process these emotions
