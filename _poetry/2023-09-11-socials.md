I looked at your Socials  
Although I know I shouldn't  
I learnt things oh I wish I wouldn't  
But trying to reconcile all that we had  
Oh that is just something I couldn't  
  
I read your socials I saw your posts  
You compared leaving me to passover  
You compared our separation to exodus  
Was us splitting really as easy as the sea?  
  
I know that and now  
I know that because  
  
I looked at your Socials  
Although I know I shouldn't   
I learnt things oh I wish I wouldn't   
But trying to reconcile all that we had  
Oh that is just something I couldn't  
  
I saw your post the one where you say  
The one where you say  
That one you say  
You only ever simply liked me as a person   
  
The one where you expressed  
Your anguish and your angst  
The one where you compared  
And came to the conclusion  
That you made a "hard decision" 
  
That decision to ends us both  
but no you didn't just do that  
You salted the earth as you left  
You burned the bridges  
You know the ones I wish we'd kept  
  
I express I'm the victim  
But understanding comphet  
That just makes it more complicated  
We're both victims but I  
I seem to be the only one who's suffering
