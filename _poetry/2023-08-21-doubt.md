Self discovery forever challenged  
Stricken by and serenaded  
The doubt from within  
The question external  
  
Pushed down through voices  
Rejected by actions  
Forced to hide to mask  
Solitude I once embraced  
  
A serenade of conforming voices  
Judgements within every tone  
Lyrics of repressive thoughts  
Conformity no more
