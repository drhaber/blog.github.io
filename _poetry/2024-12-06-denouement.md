Last night I saw you  
I know not if you saw me  
The setting was hard  
Made harder so because  
That artist was the last one I introduced you to  
  
You were are and continue to be  
A person i wish not to see  
Just witnessing you briefly  
It was more than I asked  
I was forced to think of you again  

I hate that witnessing you  
Was all it took  
Forced to know again  
A past I do not resent nor despise  
A dénouement still in progress
