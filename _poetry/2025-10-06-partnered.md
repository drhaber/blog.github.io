This isn't the first time  
Although I'm looking for forever  
I know it won't be the last  
  
Someone to spend eternity  
But one is but amiss  
Some of many a group  
  
I'll search for one  
But never simply just  
Where are each of you  
  
Each a partner for life  
A life simultaneous  
But not simply exclusive  
  
A partnership fulfilling  
All measured within  
To never truly be compared  
  
I yearn for your attention  
And squeal when is found  
A loving declaration  
  
Affirmed on a peak  
And stated with the chest  
Let's spend forever all together
