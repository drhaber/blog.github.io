A year a new  
But not for me  
Continuing forth  
Destined in time  
Elapsing with breath  
Forward moving  
Greater each time  
Happening always  
Indignation perhaps  
January a start  
Kilos bearing down  
Levity always  
Monotony a certainty  
Nights of thought  
Opportune moments  
Paving the way  
Queer as ever  
Reconfigured priorities  
Shabbat nights  
Thalamus on fire  
Underneath it all  
Vibes immaculate  
Wandering through  
Xeno-anthropology  
You know  
Zeal we will feel
