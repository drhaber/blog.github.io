I tapped the camera today  
I saw your picture  
Embossed by a brightened circle  
  
I dare not tap it for I know I have control  
The curiosity bubbling up inside  
Swipe away I do  
  
I tapped the camera this afternoon  
I saw your picture  
Embossed by a brightened circle  
  
I dare not tap it for I know I have control  
The curiosity bubbling up inside  
This circle is green and so I tapped it
