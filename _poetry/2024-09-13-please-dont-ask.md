Don’t ask how I’m doing  
It really should be obvious  
You saw the receipts  
All this pain is insidious  
I don’t want to explain it  
I don’t want to describe it  
It really should be obvious  
  
Stop trying to hype me up  
I’m really just not feeling it  
I’m forcing myself to do things  
Just let me be in my funk  
  
I will get through this  
I’ve been here before  
Don’t draw attention to it  
Don’t tell me I’m being down  
Don’t tell me how I should feel  
Don’t try to hype me up  
Just let me be in this funk  
  
I need time and company  
So please just be patient  
And please don’t ask  
Don’t ask how I am doing  
  
Don’t try to hype me up  
Just let me be in this funk  
Don’t ask how I am doing  
Just don’t  
Don’t
