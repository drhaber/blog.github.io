Did I forget because it no longer matters  
Or was it something I've never really known  
It is only but a calendar's square  
Surely it must be  
Truly  
Actually inconsequential  
  
I'll never know  
what this absence of recollection  
Will ever mean to you  
  
But to me  
  
To me it is of confusion  
Did I not know what that square represents   
Or simply  
Since you've ousted me from your life  
And I've ousted you from mine  
  
Did I simply forget  
Cause let's be honest   
Who the fuck actually cares  
  
It's only a birthday  
And I've had many  
Most of which people  
never even cared to show up for
