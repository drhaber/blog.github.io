The colours they pop  
They scream to be seen  
Each box and jar  
An ad you see  
  
They each demand your gaze  
A Technicolor charade  
Clawing for your attention  
A visual cacophony  
  
It's all on display  
So evident and blasé  
Insidious in a way  
A true boxed horror  
  
Characters and art  
Each twisted in purpose  
Urging you to purchase  
Demanding your dime  
  
This is a poor use of time  
A true waste of the creative mind  
A dystopian quality of life  
  
And  
  
I really quite loathe each design
