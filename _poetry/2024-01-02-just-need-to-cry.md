I'm stuck I'm hurt  
I'm struggling it's curt  
I feel it bubble  
I feel it swell  
  
There is no release it's just there  
I wanna cry I must  
I want to feel the emotional vomit  
Like nausea but different  
But the same it feels  
  
I'm not well even if I say  
I'm struggling you see  
Why can't I feel this  
Why can't I just  
  
Cry and cry  
I want to oh please  
Why is this so hard  
Why am I feeling like this
