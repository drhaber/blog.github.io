Here I am trapped  
Stuck within these cells  
White and bordered  
Just me my thoughts  
And the endless numbers  
Sometimes there’s math  
But lately just strings  
Alphanumeric and all so dull  
Some say things Most say nothing  
I’m trapped and confined  
How am I supposed to Excel  
These choices were a mistake  
Maybe together  
we can Access a better tomorrow  
But today I’m trapped in these faint borders  
Another string another meaningless string
