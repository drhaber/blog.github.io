Dashing through the air  
Never with any grace  
You land by my hand  
And press your face beneath  
  
We do this nightly  
This is how you ask  
You say please  
And I always oblige  
  
Fingers on your head  
The space between your eyes  
Your teeth sometimes chatter  
And your third lid peaks forth  
  
When I stop  
Or you get distracted   
You move a smidgen closer  
Or even situp  
  
I'm not entirely sure  
Your attention now elsewhere   
And so now you begin  
Your gentle little cleanse
