Home again I arrive  
Walking through the door  
Returning the coat to its hook  
As I remove my shoes I gaze  
  
I look across the space  
Into the room of elemental creation  
My mind begins to race  
It contemplates the possibilities  
  
And than it begins  
I am suddenly aware  
The weight that I am dragging  
The fatigue of the day  
  
Maybe if I just sit down  
A sofa so Cosy  
How will I ever get up  
Awaken to a deep rumble  
  
I begin to than realize  
All those possibilities  
So seemingly far  
And absolutely out of reach  
  
I ponder for eternity  
The rumble now surfacing  
I dread the effort before me  
As I stroll into that space  
  
I contemplate the options  
And I begin to acquiesce  
I pull the square from the cupboard  
Ramen for one I attest  
  
As the powder and flakes descend  
And their smell begins to rise  
I know I made a good choice   
Because it is indeed very yummy
