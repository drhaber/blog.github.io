Disconnected from your wall  
Separated but not stalled  
They gawk and they ponder  
Questions of this experience  
  
A reality so alien  
One separate of their world  
They ask what I miss  
It’s often hard to say  
  
It’s that thing in which  
You shared sometime ago  
The thing I’m only now  
Beginning to know  
  
I’m separated from your wall  
One we didn’t always need  
I feel like I’m in the past  
Relearning what I loved to ask  
  
What was that thing you shared  
That thing that you did  
Please tell me all about it  
I wish to know more  
  
So you tell me your tale  
You share your epics  
I listen and I’m enveloped  
In that thing that you shared  
  
This moment is what I gained  
And it was worth it  
God the ones that I lost  
Don’t compare to this  
  
See your life is not reduced  
I get to participate too  
It’s different from your earth  
But as any alien can see  
  
You don’t need to always paint your wall  
You can let others do that too  
I will do each of these lines for you  
Even if I must do them  
  
All by myself
