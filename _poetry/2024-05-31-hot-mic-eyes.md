I'm usually quite comfortable here  
Here in front of a hot mic  
I can hold I can speak  
I can dance I can sing  
  
Hearing my voice with just a hint of lag  
This I'm used to almost it feels like drag  
I can preform I do not mind  
I do not crave it either  
For it's just a part of life  
  
When the mic is on and I stand here  
I shake and I wimper  
I cower but not from fright  
  
I'm comfortable here  
And it's not the hot mic  
It never ever was  
It's the gaze of many pairs  
Some alive some silicon  
  
They gaze onto me  
It's a strange feeling though  
Recognizing a face among them  
Does that bring comfort?  
Or just knowledge  
  
Knowledge of these soulful windows  
a demonstration that they do care  
I know this feeling and it is empowering  
  
The hot mic is not a place of fear  
A thousands gazes and souls  
Are curious just as I  
They're here for each of us  
as we are for them  
  
I will stand tall and I will let you in  
Each every eye behind which a soul dwells  
my voice lagging just imperceptibly  
But just enough to know I try it is amplified  
  
My voice is amplified  
Your gaze is amplified  
A light's spot is directed  
These feelings aren't new  
  
They're just amplified  
And I'm happy and grateful  
  
That I  
That me  
Myself and I
