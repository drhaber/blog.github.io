I often say it is great  
That I have little complaints  
And it's true honesty  
  
But there is this one  
The one honest distaste  
It's the journey to and fro  
  
It's not a swift action for me  
Sailing down that darkened river  
Accompanied by that daily cluster  
  
This is the one true complaint  
This distance it is indeed  
Truly I must say very far
