I’ve spent an epoch  
One without an embrace  
It often makes me think of Spock  
Will I feel you in my space  
  
Such angst and uncertainty  
I know now misplaced  
Emotions before me sit definitively  
With hands intertwined nothing misshaped  
  
Your touch carries brevity  
One without haste  
A symphony towards longevity  
Powerful and with taste
