I've struggled to know who I am  
I've struggled with the confidence to brand  
I've struggled to label myself as I am  
I've struggled to live on this strand  
  
My life is not known  
My story has yet to be told  
My might will stand   
My identity within my hands  
  
I've fought with norms  
I've deconstructed and mourned  
I've slothed this night and more  
I've sought answers before  
  
My life is not known  
My story has yet to be told  
My might will stand  
My identity within my hands  
  
I've wandered to and fore  
I've walked the Valley Forge  
I've settled for less and for more  
I've quested these answers before   
  
My life is not known  
My story has yet to be told  
My might will stand  
My identity within my hands  
  
I've used new names  
I've worn new clothes  
I've flown new flags  
I've ran new paths  
  
I ride this light  
A four colored banner  
This technicolor band  
With labels a new  
  
I am new and I am me  
I am who I was  
My identity at last  
Truly visibly me
