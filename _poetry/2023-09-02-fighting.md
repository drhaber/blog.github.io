Those nights in which I do dream  
Sometimes you're there and I witness you  
I see us there always lost within that void  
Lost in the fighting and arguing  
Without time always in the past  
  
It's a mine field littered with emotion  
some wavered even Healed, maybe?  
These emotions, ubiquitous and surreal  
  
This state I'm currently living  
Listen to me this is the deal  
I feel scarred and even broken  
Left on read never ever quite heard  
Do you see as I'm stuck in limbo  
With a void closure I crave  
But these dreams leave me so  
I will not reach out  
We will not conversate stuck forever  
In my dreams we will argue and maybe  
Just maybe  
I'll be more than never quite fully healed  
  
I don't see happiness or when I do  
It is clouded in shame  
Resentment is just an emotion  
One you saved me from feeling  
  
I can thank you for that  
Oh yes and it's an unequivocal truth  
The stress and anguish  
The aniexty and panic  
  
I've been a people pleaser  
I struggled with you to ask for what I need  
And struggled with what I wanted  
The audacity within me I never asked  
  
I never asked for what I needed  
I never asked  
Instead I reached for what I wanted  
Asking for forgiveness along the way  
  
With each night when I turn to witness you  
We always find ourselves fighting  
Arguments lost in time  
  
One we never had  
language and memory  
Both capable of knowing truth  
Of prediction one I solemnly swear  
  
An argument we would have had  
Resentment is just an emotion  
One you saved me from feeling  
You Shattered that past  
  
You broke the promise  
The one most egregious of all  
Cause you promised  
You'd never hurt me  
Well fuck look at me now
