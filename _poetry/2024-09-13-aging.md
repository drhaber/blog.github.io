A month lasts a decade  
A week mere hours  
These last four years  
A lifetime  
Yet this past week a year  
  
Time is where I feel lost  
I travel through it  
With the speed of thought  
How can I slow it down  
  
It is overwhelming  
But ironically   
I cherish this challenge  
Stuck inbetween  
  
The world circles on  
I breathe in and out  
I wake and I rest  
I eat and I cleanse  
  
I struggle with the solution  
I will stick to my promise  
The promise of an edge straight  
Time will move forth  
  
And I will embrace it unimpaired
