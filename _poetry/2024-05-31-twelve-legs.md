I miss them but them is not human  
Not with me anymore  
Stuck with her  
unable for me to bring myself to see them  
For seeing them means seeing her  

I miss those little quadrupeds  
All twelve little legs  
4 white  
4 black  
4 brown  

Little furry little ones  
oh so cute oh so affectionate  
5 years with them stopped all because I couldn't do 8 with her
